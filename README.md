# RIC Escape

A conversational escape game for Google Assistant. In Spanish.

You have 30 minutes to avoid crashing your spaceship into a star, with the help of RIC, 
a Remote Interface to your Cortex. 

Developed with Firebase Functions, Actions on Google and through TDD with Mocha.

Hope you like it!

# SCURE

SCURE is the same as SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion), 
but for Ric Escape - Script Creation Utility for Ric Escape.

Check ric-escape-data to check an example of data that expects.

# TDD

I include an AcionsOnGoogleMock, that overwrites and uses as helper for tdd stuff.
