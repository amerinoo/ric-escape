# RIC Escape

A conversational escape game for Google Assistant. In English and Spanish.

You have 35 minutes to avoid crashing your spaceship into a star, with the help of RIC, 
a Remote Interface to Consciousness. 

Why is your spaceship going to crash into a star? Why is the robot willing to do so?
Discover all the misteries behind this game!

It has two endings: the wrong one and the right one. Try to unlock them both!

Developed with Firebase Functions, Actions on Google and through TDD with Mocha.

Hope you like it!

# Do you want to develop your own adventure game?

You can do it in a few minutes!

We can share knowledge & all scripts and programs. Get in touch with me and let me show you 
the SCURE utility I built with this. With SCURE you can build any scenario and game within minutes!

# SCURE

SCURE is the same as SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion), 
but for Ric Escape - Script Creation Utility for Ric Escape.

Check ric-escape-data to check an example of data the engine expects.

# TDD

I include a DialogFlowAppMock, that overwrites the DialogFlowApp and uses as helper for tdd stuff.

I also developed a walkthrough script, which does all commands needed to finish the game
successfully. A nice side effect created by developing the game through tdd!

The TDD cycle accelerated the development of the game. Practice TDD!
